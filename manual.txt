All Features SVM:
	Linear kernel:
		in svm_linclass.py, ensure that the lines that mention PCA are commented out
			(they should already be commented out in the code we provided)
		on the following line in svm_linclass.py, set C to the desired value
			("linear_svc", svm.LinearSVC(C=1, loss='squared_hinge', tol=1e-3, max_iter= 1000000, dual=False))])
		run svm_linclass.py
	Other kernels:
		in svm_polyclass.py, ensure that the lines that mention PCA are commented out
			(they should already be commented out in the code we provided)
		on the following line in svm_polyclass.py, set C and kernel to the desired values
			('linear_svc', svm.SVC(kernel="poly", C=1, degree=degree,max_iter= 1000))])
			('linear_svc', svm.SVC(kernel="rbf", C=1, max_iter= 1000))])
		run svm_polyclass.py. Comment out one of the lines. Both cannot be used at once. For radial basis function 
		comment out the frist line and for polynoimal kernels the second line
		Degree can be set at 
		degree = 2 
PCA feature-reduced SVM:
	same as All features SVM, except uncomment the following two lines:
		# pca_features = 50 #Use only when using PCA
			also set pca_features to the desired value
		# ("pca", PCA(n_components=pca_features)),
Adaboost:
	Set estimators and rate to the desired values on these lines:
		estimators = 50
		rate = 0.1
		
Plotting ROC:
	For SVM(plot_SVM.py):
	Comment out all of the lines in this section except one of them
	("linear_svc", svm.LinearSVC(C=1, loss='squared_hinge', tol=1e-3, max_iter=1000, dual=False))])
        #('linear_svc', svm.SVC(kernel="rbf",C=1, max_iter= 1000))])
        #('linear_svc', svm.SVC(kernel="poly",degree=2,C=10, max_iter= 1000))])
	For example for linear SVM do the above. For polynomial SVM comment out lines 1 and 2 and uncomment 3. Change the
	values of C or degree as needed. Takes a while to run.
	Also prints area under the various curves
	
	Adaboost (plot.py):
	Change no of estimators in this line
	estimators = 30
	Also prints area under the various curves
