All Features SVM:
	Linear kernel:
		in svm_linclass.py, ensure that the lines that mention PCA are commented out
			(they should already be commented out in the code we provided)
		on the following line in svm_linclass.py, set C to the desired value
			("linear_svc", svm.LinearSVC(C=1, loss='squared_hinge', tol=1e-3, max_iter= 1000000, dual=False))])
		run svm_linclass.py
	Other kernels:
		in svm_polyclass.py, ensure that the lines that mention PCA are commented out
			(they should already be commented out in the code we provided)
		on the following line in svm_polyclass.py, set C and kernel to the desired values
			("linear_svc", svm.LinearSVC(C=1, loss='squared_hinge', tol=1e-3, max_iter= 1000000, dual=False))])
		run svm_polyclass.py
PCA feature-reduced SVM:
	same as All features SVM, except uncomment the following two lines:
		# pca_features = 50 #Use only when using PCA
			also set pca_features to the desired value
		# ("pca", PCA(n_components=pca_features)),
Adaboost:
	Set estimators and rate to the desired values on these lines:
		estimators = 50
		rate = 0.1
